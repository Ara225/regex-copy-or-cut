# Regex Copy or Cut README

VScode extension that allows copying, cutting or even deleting all lines matching a regular expression. As of yet, it doesn't allow doing useful stuff with the text or simply finding stuff that doesn't match, so it is a little redundant

## Commands

* Delete Lines Matching Regex Pattern
* Copy Lines Matching Regex Pattern
* Cut Lines Matching Regex Pattern

## TODO 
* Allow optionally matching on plain text
* Allow automatically saving text to file 
* Allow finding text that doesn't match

## Release Notes

### 1.0.0

Initial release. Basic function, regex only matching.
